								Description
								<hr />
							</h4>

							<p>
								Farmer Jonâ€™s paying you to get his goats back to the farm before the storm comes in. Load the goats into a barrel, and roll it down the hill. Watch out for rocks, fires, and lightining. Along the way you will pick up items and collect coins. Use the items to help complete the levels and the coins to buy more items. Be carful not to drop the goats. Going too fast or taking to much damage to the barrel will cause the goats to fall out.
							</p>
							<p>
								Once the storm comes in things may get a bit harder. The goats get scared and start to lose their wit, which will make them do crazy things.
